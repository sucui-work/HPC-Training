# HPC Account Basics

### What does HPC mean?
HPC stands for High-Performance Computing.  HPC is the application of solving complex problems quickly.  In most cases these are problems that are either too large or would take too long for a standard computer.

### What is an HPC cluster? 
An HPC cluster consists of hundreds or thousands of compute servers that are networked together. Each server is called a node. The nodes in each cluster work in parallel with each other, boosting processing speed to deliver high-performance computing.

### What is HPC cluster used for?
- Research labs to help scientists find sources of renewable energy, understand the evolution of our universe, predict and track storms, and create new materials.
- Media and entertainment to edit feature films, render mind-blowing special effects, and stream live events around the world.
- Oil and gas to more accurately identify where to drill for new wells and to help boost production from existing wells.
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning  to detect credit card fraud, provide self-guided technical support, teach self-driving vehicles, and improve cancer screening techniques.
- Financial services to track real-time stock trends and automate trading.
- Medical industry to help develop cures for diseases like diabetes and cancer and to enable faster, more accurate patient diagnosis.
- To design new products, simulate test scenarios, and make sure that parts are kept in stock so that production lines arenâ€™t held up.
